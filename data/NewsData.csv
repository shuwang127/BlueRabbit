new,news,newson6.com,11/6/2019,3,2 Tulsa Brothers Arrested For Human Trafficking,"TULSA, Oklahoma - Two brothers accused of trafficking a young girl and sexually assaulting her are behind bars Wednesday evening.

Tulsa Police said brothers Kearis and Keandre Snell worked together to traffic a young girl, and possibly more victims.

An affidavit says the victim, who was 12 at the time of the assault, was dating Kearis, now 18, in April 2018.

It says Kearis ""informed her she was going to make some money,"" then it says 21-year-old Keandre sexually assaulted the girl. Kearis ""took money from Keandre for the sexual act,"" court records state.
It says Kearis ""works every girl he dates.""
""It's very prevalent here,"" said Carrie Tabor, who works with Hope 918, an organization fighting trafficking and sexual exploitation.
She said victims are often brought into human trafficking at a young age.
""This girl is 12,"" Tabor said. ""That's the average age of someone that becomes a victim of trafficking. It keeps happening younger and younger.""
The victim said Kearis threatened her after ending the relationship in July 2018.
""There were so many other victims of these two brothers potentially,"" said Andrea Graver with the non-profit Defending Dignity.

She said most of the time - traffickers know their victims.

""What we see is they're being trafficked by someone they know,"" said Graver. ""It's a boyfriend, a friend; it's a peer.""

Both women said all victims of sex trafficking have an opportunity to recover and get help.

""We are here for you,"" Graver said.

new,news,ktul.com,11/5/2019,2,Tulsa brothers arrested for allegedly trafficking underage girlfriend,"TULSA, Okla. (KTUL) — Tulsa police arrested two brothers in connection to a human trafficking investigation.

On Oct. 9, a young girl told officers she was 12 years old when she dated her ex-boyfriend, Kearis Snell, in April 2018.

She said she knocked on the front door, but Kearis was waiting for her outside. He told her she was going to ""make some money.""

When they went inside the house, he led her to a back bedroom, where she met his brother, Keandre Snell.

Keandre told the victim she would be giving him oral sex, and he told her he had money for her.

Before he could give her the money, Kearis said the money belonged to him. Keandre gave his brother about $50 to $80, according to the victim.

She broke up with Kearis in July 2018. She told police that he has constantly tried to contact her and has left multiple messages, saying she's ""his"" and that she owes him money.

The victim said Kearis had told her he'd rent a room at the Knights Inn in order to ""make money."" She refused.

She told police he also contacted her, saying she owes him money because he made a ""job"" for her and said he wanted more compensation.

The victim said Kearis ""works"" every girl he dates.

She told officers she was threatened by him multiple times and he has told her that ""nobody is going to stop me from seeing you.""

new,news,Tulsa World,11/5/2019,2,Tulsa brothers picked up on child human trafficking charges,"Two Tulsa brothers are in custody to face child human trafficking charges after the main defendant was picked up on Monday.
Kearis Travon Snell, 18, was booked into the Tulsa County jail about 11:35 a.m. on a charge of child human trafficking. His older brother, Keandre Leon Snell, 21, has been in the jail since Thursday on the same charge, plus an additional charge of lewd molestation.
Prosecutors allege Keandre paid Kearis for a sex act committed by a 12-year-old girl in the spring of 2018. The brothers were charged in Tulsa County District Court on Oct. 16.  The victim told police she had been living with Kearis Snell and that they’d been involved in a relationship. One night he met her outside and told her she was going to “make some money,” according to a probable cause affidavit.

He led her to a back room where she performed a sex act on Keandre, and Kearis pocketed Keandre’s payment, the affidavit states.

Although the victim later ended the relationship with Kearis, she told police he has since incessantly attempted to contact her and threatened her, saying that he claimed her, she is “his,” and “nobody is going to stop me from seeing you.”
“The (victim) stated that Kearis ‘works’ every girl that he dates,” the affidavit states. “She also stated that Keandre ‘messes’ with younger girls.”
The brothers remained in jail Monday afternoon on $100,000 bonds. The fault never lies on the victims, Wilson said, but on their manipulators and those providing a demand for the crime.
The men involved in sex trafficking view the girls and women not as human beings, but as property, Wilson said. They are a means to an end for their business, and there’s a demand they’re trying to keep up with.
“You’d be shocked at who’s out there buying,” Wilson said. “We’re talking people out there from all walks of life, all socioeconomic statuses, all jobs.”

The Vice Unit bears a unique burden in investigating trafficking activity in Tulsa. Detectives receive many tips and pursue countless leads, but the crime itself is elusive and difficult to prove, Wilson said.

“This is a much more difficult crime to talk about than robbery or homicide or burglary, because people report that,” Wilson said. “There’s so much more going on that we don’t know about, and we know about a lot.”
Wilson said most females are victimized by someone they know, be it an acquaintance, friend, significant other, or even family member, and he urged residents to be in the know about their loved ones’ lives.
Be aware of what people are capable of, know the dangers of social media and dating apps, and make an effort to know who your loved one is hanging out with, Wilson said.
“Ignorance is bliss,” Wilson said. “But if you turn a blind eye to what is out there, you run the risk of somebody that you love being a victim.”
Lt. Brian Wilson, who oversees the Tulsa Police Department’s Vice Unit, said although it’s a common perception that most human trafficking victims come from out of state, it’s not the case in Tulsa.
“Disturbingly enough, it’s the girls and women here in Tulsa who are becoming victims of human trafficking,” he said.
Wilson said the most common victims are runaways or girls who have not been provided a healthy support system, and they are often victimized by people they think they can trust.",Tulsa,Oklahoma,4,3,African-American,https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/tulsa-brothers-picked-up-on-child-human-trafficking-charges/article_a1cf9f01-a58e-570f-9682-0814e1940b94.html

Carter pleaded guilty on Aug. 31, 2015.  According to court documents, Carter was a leader of a gang known as “Scheme Team.”  In addition to robbery, narcotics, and weapons trafficking, Carter and Scheme Team generated revenue by sex trafficking teenage girls and adults.  One of the girls sex trafficked by Carter was 15 years old.  Carter instructed victims to lie to customers by telling them that they were over 18 years old, unless a customer requested an underage girl.  Despite their youth, Carter instructed the victims to submit to any sex acts that customers demanded.  In addition to exploiting these minors for profit, Carter also used these victims for his own sexual gratification.

Carter sex trafficked women and girls in 2014 and 2015 in Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  Carter set a monetary quota of $1,000 per day, which victims were required to earn, and the victims generally met this quota.  Carter received nearly all of the commercial sex proceeds earned by the girls he sex trafficked, and he sometimes required victims to submit to searches to ensure they were not keeping any of the prostitution proceeds from Carter.

To keep victims compliant, Carter frequently provided them with alcoholic beverages and controlled substances, including OxyContin, Percocet, molly, spice (also known as “K2”), Xanax, Roxicodone, and marijuana.  Carter also told victims that he had guns, threatened victims with violence, and used physical force on victims, including pulling their hair and shoving them.

The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation into the Nine Trey Gangsters, designated Operation Ruby Red and Operation Full Blooded Ink, led to the arrest and prosecution of 37 gang members in the Eastern District of Virginia since 2013, resulting in a total of approximately 415 years in prison for the gang members.

Other related criminal activity, which often accompanies criminal street gangs, was also discovered, including conspiracy to commit racketeering, violence in aid of racketeering, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, conspiracy to distribute counterfeit currency, and possession and use of firearms.

havecase,news,InsideNOVA,9/4/2013,3,Feds: 24 gangsters indicted in Operation ‘Ruby Red’ ,"Twenty-four suspected Nine Trey Gangsters, a subgroup of the Bloods street gang, have been indicted on racketeering, drug, sex trafficking and other charges, a spokesman from the U.S. Attorney’s office said Wednesday.
The indictment naming 24 members and associates of the gang, many of whom are from Manassas and Prince William County, was unsealed Wednesday afternoon, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s office.
“Today’s arrests send a clear message that violent gangs have no place in our community,” Valerie Parlave, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field office said in the news release. “While you may not see violence on your neighborhood street, gang members attempt to rule through violence and intimidation, a dangerous mix for impressionable youth within our region. Together with our partners in Fairfax County, the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, and other law enforcement agencies, we will work to eradicate violent gangs and bring their members to justice.”
Prosecutors said Thaddaeus Snow, of Manassas, and Curtis Martino, of Elkridge, Md., led two “line-ups” of the Nine Trey Gangsters who committed illegal activities in Virginia, Washington and Maryland. According to the news release, authorities believe that between 2008 and this year, the two groups of gangsters “engaged in racketeering activity involving the transportation and prostitution of women using force and coercion in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, New York, and elsewhere; the commission of robberies; and the distribution of cocaine, crack, marijuana, heroin, ecstasy, and prescription painkillers.” 
The suspected gang members are also accused of using counterfeit money to finance drug purchases, according to the news release.
The indictment and related court documents were not immediately available Wednesday afternoon.
The indictment alleges several acts of violence undertaken by gang members.  On or about April 1, 2010, according to the indictment, Snow directed gang members Janee Yates, of Warrenton, and William Sykes, of Bealeton, to give a female victim a “buck-fifty,” consisting of slashing the face with a knife from mouth to ear with the aim of requiring 150 stiches to close the wound, because the woman had stolen proceeds of the gang’s drug sales.  Prosecutors said the alleged gangsters were also involved in a shooting on April 12, 2010.
The case, part of an Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force investigation called Operation “Ruby Red,” was investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Fairfax County Police Department, with assistance from the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, Hampton Police Department, Fauquier County Sheriff’s Office, Manassas City Police Department, and the United States Marshal Service, according to the news release.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Thaddaeus Snow, a/k/a “Storm,” 34, of Manassas, Va., was sentenced today to 40 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release and registration as a sex offender.  
William Sykes, a/k/a “Black,” 29, of Bealeton, Va., was sentenced to 30 years in prison, five years of supervised release and registration as a sex offender.
Both men were convicted on Feb. 21, 2014, by a federal jury of charges that included conspiracy to commit racketeering, violence in aid of racketeering, robbery, conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force and coercion and multiple firearms offenses.
Dana J. Boente, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Valerie Parlave, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office; and Colonel Edwin C. Roessler, Jr., Fairfax County Chief of Police, made the announcement after sentencing by U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.
“These defendants and their fellow gang members threatened the safety of our communities by committing acts of violence, dealing drugs, and dehumanizing women through prostitution by force and coercion,” said U.S. Attorney Boente.  “I want to commend our federal, state and local law enforcement partners for their commitment to dismantling this dangerous gang and combatting these pernicious crimes.”
“The sentences handed down today send a clear message to members of these violent criminal enterprises: we will not tolerate your illegal activities,” said Assistant Director in Charge Parlave.  “The FBI, through the Northern Virginia Gang Task Force and our partners in local law enforcement, will continue to systematically target, investigate and prosecute gang members who use violence to threaten our communities.”
Snow and Sykes were indicted by a federal grand jury on Sept. 26, 2013, along with twenty-two other members and associates of the Nine Trey Gangsters street gang, on charges of conspiracy to commit racketeering, violence in aid of racketeering, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to distribute 280 grams or more of crack cocaine and multiple counts related to the possession and use of firearms.
According to court records and evidence presented at trial, the Nine Trey Gangsters are a Bloods street gang set of the United Blood Nation, which was founded in New York City in the early 1970’s.  Thaddaeus Snow led a “line-up” of the Nine Trey Gangsters that operated as a criminal enterprise in Virginia and committed criminal activity in multiple states.  From 2008 until the date of the indictment, Snow’s line-ups of Nine Trey gangsters engaged in racketeering activity involving the sex trafficking of women using force and coercion in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, New York and elsewhere; the commission of robberies; and the distribution of cocaine, crack, marijuana, heroin, ecstasy and prescription painkillers.  The evidence at trial also showed that Snow, Sykes and other Nine Trey Gangsters dealt in counterfeit U.S. currency and used counterfeit currency to finance wholesale drug purchases.
In addition, the evidence at trial showed that Snow and his subordinate gang members undertook several acts of violence.  On or about April 1, 2010, Snow directed Nine Trey Gangsters to give a female victim a “buck-fifty,” consisting of slashing the woman’s face with a knife from mouth to ear with the aim of requiring 150 stiches to close the wound, because the woman had stolen proceeds of Snow’s drug sales and used some of Snow’s drug supply.  The slashing was carried out by Sykes.  Sykes and other gang members beat a man unconscious who may have stolen drugs from a gang member, and Sykes also committed a shooting on April 12, 2010, after the shooting victims became involved in a dispute with one of the gang members.  Additionally, Sykes slapped and choked a prostitute when she concealed money she earned from him.
Snow and Sykes were convicted following a trial that began on Feb. 11, 2014.  All twenty-four individuals named in the Sept. 26, 2013 indictment have been convicted, bringing to 37 the total number of Nine Trey Gangsters members and associates who have been convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia since 2013.
This case was investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Fairfax County Police Department, with assistance from the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, Hampton Police Department, Fauquier County Sheriff’s Office, Manassas City Police Department and the U.S. Marshals Service.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Adam B. Schwartz and Dennis M. Fitzpatrick prosecuted the case on behalf of the United States.

havecase,news,NA,6/26/2012,2,Justin Strom pleads guilty to sex trafficking,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - An alleged street gang member admitted his role Tuesday in a prostitution ring that recruited high school girls for paid sex acts and threatened those who refused to participate.
Justin Strom, who prosecutors say ran the ring and recruited at least eight girls to participate over a six-year period, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court here to sex trafficking of a child. He faces a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum life sentence under the terms of his plea agreement.
He is the last of five men who were charged in March to plead guilty in the investigation. Authorities say the five are members and associates of a Fairfax County-based offshoot of the Crips street gang known as the Underground Gangster Crips.
The group used social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace to recruit underage girls, promising them a cut of the proceeds for paid sex acts, plying them with illegal drugs like cocaine and supplying condoms, federal authorities say. Some of the girls told authorities that they were forced to have sex with Strom or other gang members as a tryout or initiation.
One girl told authorities that Strom approached her at a Metro station in 2009 - when she was 16 years old - told her she was pretty and that she could earn money by having sex. She said they had sex in the woods behind the Metro station after Strom told her that ""he needed to see if it was good first,"" and then worked as a prostitute for him that spring and summer, according to an FBI affidavit.
Some of the girls who tried to quit the operation said they were either threatened with violence or, in some cases, physically attacked, the affidavit says.
Neil MacBride, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said after the hearing that the case sent a message that sex traffickers weren't welcome in the state and would be arrested, prosecuted and exposed to long prison sentences.
""This will permanently scar young lives,"" said Ronald Hosko, the special agent in charge of the criminal division at the FBI's Washington field office.

new,news,SeattleTimes,1/7/2016,4,"Large prostitution ring, Bellevue brothels shut down","A Seattle-area investigation has resulted in the shutdown of two sex-trafficking websites, the shuttering of 12 brothels and the arrest of about a dozen people.
Twelve men and one woman have been charged with promoting prostitution following a wide-ranging investigation that resulted in the shutdown of 12 brothels in Bellevue and the seizure of two sex-trafficking sites, according to police and prosecutors.
The brothels were operated out of high-end apartment complexes in Bellevue, where prostituted women from South Korea were forced to work often for 12 hours a day, seven days a week, to pay off debts, according to Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett.
One of the brothel owners is an alleged member of “The League,” an exclusive group of local sex buyers who were also charged with promoting prostitution after being infiltrated by undercover detectives, he said.
Prosecutor Dan Satterberg said King County is the first jurisdiction in the country to charge “an organized group of sex buyers” with promoting the prostitution of women from South Korea, who are brought to the U.S. to work as prostitutes and are shuttled between major cities.
The joint operation between Bellevue police and the King County Sheriff’s Office led to the seizure Tuesday of website TheReviewboard.net and a sister site called kgirldelights.com, with the “K” standing for Korea, officials announced at a news conference Thursday.
TheReviewboard.net, with an estimated 23,000 members, allowed men to post graphic descriptions of their sexual encounters with prostituted women and share tips to avoid police attention and suspicion from wives and girlfriends, according to charging papers.
“This website facilitated prostitution,” Sheriff John Urquhart said at a news conference.
Sigurd Zitars, 61, is the owner and operator of TheReviewboard.net, according to charging papers. Zitars and a group of 50 of his most prolific posters nationwide established themselves as an exclusive, invitation-only group that called itself “The League,” police and prosecutors say.
All but two of the people arrested Tuesday are alleged local members of The League.
Members of The League set up the kgirldelights.com site to advertise South Korean women after Zitars — who goes by the handle “Tahoe Ted” — decided to restrict the number of Asian sex workers on his site to avoid police notice, charging papers say.
Both websites worked with agencies that move women from city to city after they arrived in the U.S. and “bookers” who book appointments for the women, according to the charges.
Members of “The League,” who used anonymous handles instead of their real names, would regularly meet at local pubs or restaurants. Many times “the discussions were so graphic that patrons sitting at tables next to us would get up and leave or move to another table,” an undercover detective, who infiltrated the group, wrote in charging documents.
In many instances, police identified League members by following them to their vehicles and running their license plate numbers. Several of the meetings were also secretly recorded by police, the charges say.
“Many of the members made comments that indicated they were aware these girls were more than likely trafficked and had little choice in choosing to work as prostitutes,” say the charges.
Zitars was arrested Tuesday along with alleged League members Charles Peters, 46; Justin Yoon, 45; Stephen Jenkins, 44; Lawrence Masaki, 44; Mark Yamada, 54; Keith Emmanuel, 28; Noah Jorgenson, 27; and Donald Mueller, 58.
Except for Mueller, all of the men are being held in lieu of $75,000 bail. Richard Homchick, 49, has also been charged with second-degree promoting prostitution, but his name does not appear in the King County Jail register.
The men paid an estimated $300 per encounter with dozens, if not hundreds, of women, say the charges. 
Mueller, who is also accused of running brothels out of high-end, luxury apartments in Bellevue, is being held in lieu of $150,000 bail, as is Michael Durnal, 47. Durnal was not a member of The League but signed a lease for Mueller before the pair had a falling out and Durnal allegedly started up his own brothel, say the charges.
Mueller is a longtime sex buyer who previously had made his living off illegal marijuana grows, but moved into prostitution when the drug was legalized, the charges say.
Jabong “Crystal” Kim, a Korean national and former sex worker, is the sole woman so far charged in the case, according to charging documents. She, too, is accused of running a brothel and is now being held without bail in the King County Jail, say jail and court records.
Urquhart said the arrests are just the beginning of a very complicated investigation and additional arrests and charges are possible.
Urquhart said detectives also have the names and photos of thousands of men who signed up for accounts on TheReviewboard.net, but he said it’s unlikely those men will face misdemeanor prostitution charges.
Urquhart said the investigation into TheReveiwboard.net and “The League” is “unprecedented in size and scope” in the region. Twelve South Korean women were rescued from the brothels and will be eligible for visas to remain in the U.S., he said.
Urquhart said many of the women were forced to work as prostitutes in order to pay off debt incurred by traveling to the U.S.
“These women are true victims, make no mistake about it,” said Urquhart.
The sheriff’s office, which has been investigating TheReviewboard.net for years, launched an investigation last spring after a sex-trafficking victim told authorities she had been brought to the U.S. from South Korea and coerced into prostitution to pay off a family debt, Urquhart said.
Mylett, noting some believe prostitution is a victimless crime, said one woman killed last April in a Bellevue apartment worked as a prostitute, though her death is unrelated to the current investigation.
Song Wang, 30, is accused of killing a 37-year-old Bellevue woman and torching her apartment. He has been charged with first-degree murder and first-degree arson, accused of fatally stabbing Kittaporn Saosawatsri and torching her apartment.
One former Seattle-area sex worker decried the shutdown of thereviewboard.net, saying it now forces sex workers to go into the street where prospective customers cannot be screened. The website allowed sex workers to vet potential clients.
“It (the shutdown) increases the odds a sex worker needing to make rent will take an unverified client,” Savannah Sly, president of the Sex Worker Outreach Project, wrote in an email.",Bellevue,Seattle,9,12,Mix,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/online-site-where-men-rated-prostitutes-is-shut-down-charges-to-be-filed/

He recruited the girl to engage in the acts at various hotels in Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.
McDonald took pictures of the girl, posted ads for her sex services online and arranged prostitution appointments for her.

anlaysis,news,WSLS,10/4/2018,4,Virginia ranks 6th in active federal human trafficking cases,"New report shows statistics on number of federal human trafficking cases WASHINGTON D.C. – Nearly two thousand cases of human trafficking saw a courtroom in the United States last year. Virginia is one of the most aggressive states when it comes to prosecuting this offense according to a new report by the Human Trafficking Institute. The report provides an account of all the criminal and civil human trafficking cases handled by federal courts during 2017. A team of 12 attorneys and 8 law school students reviewed every human trafficking case in the federal court system in 2017. In addition, court documents, press releases, and news sources were used to gather a comprehensive set of data to include type of trafficking case, business model, age of the victim, and district where the case took place, among others. Out of all states and U.S. territories, Virginia ranks 6th for the most human trafficking cases on federal court dockets. Kyleigh Feehs, Associate Legal Counsel for the Human Trafficking Institute composed the report. She said the team hopes the data can be used to help policy makers across the country. ""What we are realizing is that traffickers are currently acting with impunity and there is a need for accountability in this space,” Feehs said. “As part of that process we wanted to publish this report to look at what are we doing here within the United States to increase those efforts to hold those traffickers accountable.” In 2017, there were 783 active criminal and civil human trafficking cases involving 1,930 defendants working their way through the federal court system in the United States. According to the report, 88.8% of active human trafficking cases were criminal matters and 11.2% were civil suits. In 2017 there were 33 active human trafficking cases in Virginia. The report is the first of its kind and the first snapshot given of the number of federal human trafficking cases across the country and the commonwealth over the past decade. The new report shows which states are most actively combating human trafficking crimes and how the commonwealth measures up. Three of those cases were in the Western district, while the remaining 30 were in the eastern district. Feehs said the report doesn't reflect the prevalence of the crime, but instead how aggressively law enforcement is pursing the perpetrators. She said due to the population makeup of the eastern district, it is no surprise that more cases were prosecuted there. Virginia's 33 active human trafficking cases in 2017 generated 401 federal charges involving 74 defendants.Of those 33 cases, 75 percent involved sex trafficking and the remaining 25 percent of cases involved labor trafficking. “We really want these numbers to fuel conversation of what we can do to increase the amount of time that the defendant is ordered to pay restitution to his or her victim,” Feehs said.
Two defendants were ordered to pay restitution in Virginia in 2017, ranking the state 9th of 55 (tied with 4 other U.S. states and territories).",DC,DC,NA,NA,NA,https://www.wsls.com/news/2018/10/04/virginia-ranks-6th-in-active-federal-human-trafficking-cases/

Cornell Devore Rhymes, 32, conspired with others, including Justin Robinson and Markus Plummer, who were previously convicted, to force and coerce young women into commercial sex work during August 2017, U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors said in the news release.
Over a period of about three months, Rhymes and the other men “recruited young women, including a minor, into commercial sex work,” prosecutors said. 
“The men advertised the women for sex acts, set their ‘dates’ and collected and retained the profits,” the news release said.
The men’s crimes came to light after one of their victims, a 16-year-old female runaway, managed to contact police from the Motel 6 in Dumfries. Officers rescued her at the motel, according to court documents.
Before his trial, Rhymes pleaded guilty possession of a firearm as a felon, after law-enforcement officers executed a search warrant and seized a gun from his home.

Results: The double list experiment found the prevalence of sex purchasing is roughly 1 of every 50 adult males

(4%) had purchased sex in die past 3 years How they purchased and who they purchased sex from was also
