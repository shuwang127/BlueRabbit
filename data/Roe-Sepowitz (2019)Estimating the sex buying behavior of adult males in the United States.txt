ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT

Keywords: Propose: Estimating the size of the sex buyer market in the United States has been stymied by methodological
53* buyers and sampling challenges. Given known methodologiar] issues in self-reporting and the sensitive nature of
Prostitution purchasing sex, cunent research faces challenges in providing estimates of demand for purchasing sex. This
5:33:13] sex study used a unique approach to estimate the prevalence of sex buying by men over the age of 18 in die United

States.

Methods This study employed a double list experiment and a direct ask question to a nationally representative
sample of 2525 adult males to estimate die size of the sex buyer market in die United States.

Results: The double list experiment found the prevalence of sex purchasing is roughly 1 of every 50 adult males
in the US. (2%) over the 3years. The direct ask questions found that roughly 1 of every 25 males in the U.S.
(4%) had purchased sex in die past 3 years How they purchased and who they purchased sex from was also
explored. A total of 30 respondents reported buying sex during the past 3years. They spent an average of $120
for their most recent sex-buying encounter. Most sex buyers reported buying sex from an ofﬂine venue (street,
bar, or massage parlor) and 81% purchased sex from a female. Applying the estimate of sex buying behavior to
the genera] male population in the U15. results in approximately 4 million men over the age of 13 purchasing sex
the past 3years.

Combisions: The ﬁndings from both the double list experiment and the direct ask question indicate that buying
sex is a relatively rare phenomenon arnong adult males, however, when accounting for multiple purchases and
extrapolating to the entire population the estimated purchases is in the millions. Applying the double list ex-
periment and a direct ask question to a nationally representative sample provides a new way to capture estimates
while addressing some of the limitations of previous methods. Such ﬁndings have implications for both the
criminal justice and public health sectors.

1 . Introduction

The commercial sex industry describes the proﬁt-driven market of
transactional sex and sexual services. Within the industry a variety of
direct (e.g. prostitution} and indirect sexual services (e.g. pornography
and exotic dancing] transpire (Wcitzcr, 2012). The acts of selling and
purchasing sex are illegal and under certain legal contexts, including
the removal of consent through force, fraud or coercion or if a minor is
involved in the act, are statutorily deﬁned as sex trafﬁcking crimes (Yu.
2011). Debates about the normative and moral nature of the commer-
cial sex industry are common features of academic research on this
issue. Some inquiries characterize buying and selling sex as immoral,

illegal and harmful - especially to women - while others argue that it is
a personal, reasonable and private choice (see Gerassi, 2015; Moran 81
Farley, 2019; Wilson 8: Butler, 2014; Weitzer, 2012). While this ex-
change provides insight into the motives, perceptions and character-
istics of those engaged in purchasing/providing sex, the scope and scale
of the United States' sex market has yet to be deﬁnitively addressed by
researchers. Recognizing that there are very strong and differing per-
spectives about the nature of exchanging money for sexual services, the
purview of this study is narrowly focused on examining market features
— speciﬁcally the demand for prostitution in the United States (US). This
research does not engage the various positions on sex work, nor does it
support or refute any speciﬁc arguments about the industry. Rather, the

sole goal is to provide a new methodology in estimating the demand for
sexual services that can be utilized by researchers across theoretical and
moral paradigms to understand the extent of purchasing behaviors
within the commercial sex industry.

Determining how many men within the US acquire services from a
personl exchanging sex for money and how often they engage in this
behavior is a complex endeavor. Sex markets are illegal throughout
most of the country, and empirical efforts to understand industry dy-
namics have largely focused on sex trafﬁcking, victimization and in-
tervention efforts. Further, the tension between opposing views of
prostitution - trafﬁcking/slavery at one extreme and a natural right on
the opposite - has created barriers to understanding buying/selling sex
as a market like any other (Monto, 2004, Monto, 2010; Pinto, 2011;
Shively, Kliorys, Wheeler, 3: Hunt, 2012). Finally, commercial sex stu-
dies are often restricted to women who sell sex, though in recent years
researchers have begun to explore consumers as well [see Farley,
MacLeod, Anderson, 8: Golding, 2011; Milrod s Monto, 2012; Monto,
2010].

Prior studies of sex buyers (also referred to as “consumers", “pur-
chasers”, “solicitors” and “johns”) have focused primarily on exploring
the characteristics and motives of men who pay for sex. A recent study
of sex trafﬁcking in Denver encompassed both ofﬁcial arrest data on
purchasers and law enforcement perceptions of the scope of demand for
illegal commercial sex (Morris et al., 2012). The report found that sex
purchasers were on average, 40 years old and most were white. Other
research supports the contention that there are demographic simila-
rities among consumers; most are males, many are married with chil-
dren, between 30 and 50 years old, purchase at least once a year and
come from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds (Chicago Coalition for the
Homeless, 2004; Durschlag 8: Goswami, 2008; Farley et al., 2011;
Kosloski, Bontrager Ryan, 8: Roe-Sepowitz, 2017; Milrod 8: Monte,
2012; Monte, 2004; Shively et al., 2012). As noted by Morris et al.
(2012) research ﬁndings about sex buyers are not robust to methodo-
logical deviations. Simply including arrested purchasers, a logical de-
sign choice, in their sample negated the relationship between marital
status and soliciting sex {Morris et al., 2012).

Research on the sex purchasers relies on speciﬁc geographic loca-
tions, using convenience samples or discrete moments in time to ex-
plore soliciting. For example, the Shapiro Group attempted to estimate
how many men were buying sex from ‘young’ girls from online venues
in Georgia. 'Nhile valuable information was gained from the research,
their study did not result in a robust and replicable model (National
Academy of Sciences, 2013; Pinto, 2011). Inquiries on the scope of sex
buying among adult males, to date, rely exclusively on non-re-
presentative samples of the population, producing highly variable—
from less than 1% to over 16% - estimates of sex buyers in the US
(Monto S: Milrod, 2014). Studies conducted in Chicago, Scotland, Las
Vegas, Portland and Denver provide diverse descriptions of men who
purchase sex, but none utilize a representative sample of solicitors and
most operationalize soliciting as purchasing at any point in the past
(Durschlag 8r Goswami, 2008; Farley et al., 20]]; Monto & McKee,
2005; Memo 8: Milrod, 2014; Morris et al., 2012). These studies fall
short of generalizability and cannot estimate the number of active sex
market consumers, but they have contributed to our collective under-
standing of purchasing methods, buyer motivations and solicitor char-
acteristics. Building from this foundation, there is a clear directive for
innovative approaches to ensure an accurate and generalizable assess-
ment of the prevalence of sex purchasing in the US.

This research employs a new survey approach for determining the
number of sex buyers in the US based on a list item experiment and a
direct ask question of potential male solicitors. This design, in combi-
nation with a representative sample of adult males, produces an

accurate and generalizable estimate of the percent of males within the
US who have bought sex from a prostitute in the past Byears. Given
changes to online purchasing platforms (e.g. moving from credit cards
to Bitcoin) and how purchasers solicit sex (e.g. street, online, etc.), the
survey also captures this information among this sample. Being able to
reﬁne estimates of sex purchasing prevalence has important implica-
tions for research on the commercial sex industry, including the full
range of sex work and sex trafﬁcking scholars. Moving beyond the labor
versus slavery discussion, the emphasis here is on creating a new
technique for understanding the extent of active sex buying in the US
and enhancing our knowledge of the commercial sex market.

2. Literature review

To date, research on sex buyers largely focuses on motives for
purchasing sex and the demographic background of buyers. In doing so,
researchers have discovered that some sex purchasers rationalize their
behavior as ‘normal', they feel entitled as men to buy sex, they often
hold negative views of women, and they are more likely than non-
purchasers to harm their sexual partners (Durschlag Sc Goswanri, 2008;
Farley et al., 2011; Janson, Durchslag, 8: Mann, 2013; Milrod 81 Monto,
2012; Monto, 2004, 2010; Monte 81 Hotaling, 2001; Shively et al.,
2012). Sex buyers use indoor and outdoor methods for soliciting sex. Of
individuals that admitted to purchasing sex a total of 63% of Farley
et al. (2011) study participans indicated they approached women on
the street to purchase sex. Purchasing online is a widely used method as
advertisements for escorts and commercial sex are readily available
from websites, forums, and social networking sites (Finn 8: Stalans,
2016; Holt 8: Blevins, 2007; Milrod S: Monto, 2012). Other sex buyers
report seeking the encounter in bars, strip clubs, and massage parlors
(Farley et al., 2011).

Research on prostitution purchasing behaviors largely comes from
data collected at john schools:2 and online discussion boards. These
studies reveal important information regarding the motives, attitudes,
and practices for purchasing sex, however, they do not reﬂect the true
extent of such practices within the United States. Research from the
Urban 1nstitute indicates that these sources are unreliable since they are
“only the tip of the iceberg for a largely hidden crime” (Dank et al.,
2014, p.B). For this reason, recent attempts to provide more accurate
information through survey data have been incorporated into research
on demand for prostitution. Using a robust modeling technique, the
following section describes a new technique for estimating and vali-
dating the number of sex buyers in the United States.

2.1. Methods of eso'maalng purchosorg

In a review of 181 studies on commercial sex, Wilcox, Christmann,
Rogerson, and Birch (2009) reported signiﬁcant methodological issues
in estimating demand for prostitution. Given that prostitution is largely
illegal in the United States, controversial, stigmatizing, and buyers can
solicit online and out of public view, estimates of purchasing behavior
have been difﬁcult to assess (Monto & Milrod, 2014; Roe-Sepowitz,
Bontrager Ryon, Hickle, Gallagher, 8: Hedberg, 2016; Wilcox et al.,
2009). Attempts to ﬁne-tune the methodologies used to produce esti-
mates of sex purchasing behaviors have included the use of large-scale
surveys and a capture-recapture approach.

Recent attempts to estimate the prevalence of the sex buyer popu-
lation have utilized large-scale surveys. Monto and Milrod (2014) relied
on the General Social Survey to pull from a nationally representative
sample. The General Social Survey asks if respondents if they “have

ever paid for sex in their lifetime” and if they “paid for sex in the last
year” in addition to general attitudinal questions regarding sex. Monto
and Milrod (2014) concluded that roughly 14% of men between 18 and
75 years old, sampled between 2002 and 2010, reported having paid for
sex during their lifetime. Additionally, they found that about 1% re-
ported buying sex in the past year.

Surveys especially for sensitive topics of inquiry are prone to un-
der'reporting (Brewer, Roberts, Moth, 8: Potterat. 2008). Relying on
capture/recapture techniques, ecological modeling adapted to socio-
logical phenomena, researchers have successfully estimated the number
of drug users in London (llickman et al.. 2002). Simply, a sample is
observed at time 1 and compared to a similar sample within a geo-
graphic region at time 2. The overlap of elements in the two groups is
the recapture estimate (Larson, Stevens, 8: Wardlaw, 1994). Using the
same technique, Brewer et al. (2008) were the ﬁrst to attempt the
complex task of creating an estimate of the size of the population of
street prostitution customers in the United States using a capture-re-
capture method. This method used arrest records for prostitution in six
cities in the United States and matched them with county data they
estimated 2—3% percent of adult male residents in several large me-
tropolitan areas in the United States patronized local street prostitutes
(Brewer ct al., 2008).

Roe Sepowitz et al. (2016) used a similar capture-recapture ap-
proach to study demand for prostitution online. In Invisﬂile Offenders: A
Study of Online Sex Customers,Roe Scpowitz et al. (2016) placed decoy
ads on common solicitation websites for illegal commercial sex in 15
metropolitan cities. They then captured potential buyers telephone
numbers when responding to the decoy ads. The data was de-identiﬁed
and was then used for the capture-recapture calculation to create
probability estimates of demand size in some metropolitan cities in the
United States. They found that 1 out of every 20 males adult males in a
metropolitan city area was soliciting online sex ads or that 3% of adult
males in these cities were buying sex online. This capture-recapture
approach used by Brewer et al. (2008) and Roe Sepowitz et al. (2016)
does require knowing that either a charge has been ﬁled via ofﬁcial law
enforcement records or that the intention of someone who contacts the
ads is in fact to purchase sex. In using the capture-recapture method
online, changes to soliciting website availability (e.g. Backpage.conr)
has limited the feasibility of this approach at this time. To account for
limitations in current methods to 355855 purchasing prevalence, the
current study provides a new strategy for estimating the prevalence of
sex buying behavior using a double list experiment and a direct ask
question.

3. Methodology

Multiple surveys were created by the authors and resulted in
questions including; responses to prevalence of paying for a sexual
encounter from a prostituted person, policy attitudes towards prosti-
tution, assessment of opinions about characteristics of prostituted per-
sons and sex buyers, assessment of the participant's understanding of
the consequences of prostitution, assessment of the perceived victimi-
zation risk and media exposure, gender ideology and moral founda-
tions, religiosity and moral foundation, prior arrest, and characteristics
of the participant's last prostitution incident. This study was approved
by the Arizona State University Institutional Review Board. This ques-
tionnaire was reviewed by a sex trafﬁcking survivor-leader whose
feedback was integrated into the survey. The questionnaire took an
average of 7min for the participants to complete. The survey instru-
ment utilized both indirect and direct questions.

3.1. Sample and data collection procedure
To determine the national prevalence of sex purchasing among

American men, the Growth from Knowledge or GtK Group (formally
Knowledge Networks) was commissioned to administer a survey to a

43

Journal of Criminal Justice 63 (2019) 4148

representative sample of 2525 adult (18 or older] men residing in the
United States. This targeted sample size was chosen to yield a maximum
margin of error of i 2 percentage points. The GtK Group sampled re-
spondents from its KnowledgePanel. The KnoweldgePanel is a pre-re-
cruited and probability-based online panel, which is representative of
the general population {Dillnran, Smyth, 8: Christian, 2014:
'l‘ourangeau, Conrad, 8r Cooper, 2013). Panelists were initially recruited
into the KnowledgePanel through random sampling of addresses using
the United States Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File. To extend
coverage to members of the public who are not Internet users, the GfK
Group provided individuals who lacked computers and/or 1ntemet
access with these facilities when they joined the KnowledgePanel. After
joining the panel, panelists periodically receive email invitations to
participate in surveys. These surveys are self-administered through the
respondents' (or the GiK-provided) computers.

The GfK Group (and KnowledgePanel) is a market leader for prob-
ability-based online surveys (Weinberg, Freesc, 8: McElhattan, 2014).
Allcott (201]) opines that GfK has developed a superior survey platform
that is publicly available to social scientist. The KnowledgePanel has
regularly been used by both the Time-Sharing Experiments for the So-
cial Sciences, an ongoing interdisciplinary program funded by the Na-
tional Science Foundation (NSF), and the American National Election
Studies to ﬁeld general population surveys (Mutz, 2011). Chang and
Krosnick (2009, p. 641) demonstrated that probability-based 1ntemet
surveys ﬁelded with the KnowledgePanel manifested “the optimal
combination of sample composition accuracy and self-report accuracy.”
They found that KnowledgePanel surveys yielded higher quality data
than random telephone questionnaires, containing lower levels of
random measurement error, satisﬁcing, and social desirability bias.

The survey was ﬁelded between January 10 and 14, 2017. The
target sample size was 2500 participants. GfK sent invitations to par-
ticipate to a total of 5000 male panelists over the age of 18, and re-
minder emails were sent to non- responders on the third day of the
administration period. A total of 2525 (51% participation] men en-
gaged in the survey. The American Association for Public Opinion
Research‘s Standard Deﬁnitions (2016, pp. 48—49) provides formulas for
calculating the ﬁnal outcome rates in surveys with pre-recniited,
probability-based online panels. Per these calculations, the survey
completion rate (COMR), or the rate of response to the survey imitation
among eligible panel members, was 50.5% (2525/5000 x 100). The
average initial recruitment rate (RECR) into the panel was 12.9%, and
the average proﬁle rate (PROR) was 64.9%. In turn, the cumulative
response rate (CUMRR = COMR X PROR X RECR) was 4.2%. This
CUMRR is typical of response rates administered to pre-recruited
probability-based online panels. Meta-analyses have shown that survey
response rates are weakly related to nonresponse bias, which varies
mostly at the estimate rather than survey-level (Groves, 2006; Groves 81
Pcytcheva. 2008). Krosnick, Presser, Foaling, 81 Ruggles (2012, p. 6)
recent report on survey research methods to the National Science
Foundation emphasized this point: “nonresponse bias is rarely notably
related to [the] nonresponse rate.”

Of the respondents who participated in the survey, 2498 (or 98.9%)
answered the indirect questions about purchasing sex, and 2484 (or
98.4%) answered the direct question (see below). For the analyses, the
data were weighted to account for respondents' probability of selection,
and to adjust for population benchmarks from the Current Population
Survey. Table 1 presents both the unweighted and weighted demo-
graphic characteristics of the sample.

Of the sample, the unweighted mean age was 50 years old (weighted
47 years), was 72% White, 8.6% Black, and12% Hispanic (weighted
65%, 11%, 16% respectively). A total of 61% of the respondents were
married (57% weighted), an overwhelming majority were employed
(95% non-weighted; 94% weighted). Most had some education as 27%
had a high school degree, 28% had attended some college or had an
Associate degree, 21.6% had earned Bachelor's degree, and nearly 16%
had a Graduate degree (weighted 30%, 27%, 17%, 13% respectively).

3.2. Survey measures

3.2.1. Indirect questions

In surveys dealing with sensitive topics, indirect questioning tech-
niques are used to reduce under- and over-reporting, as well as item
nonresponse, by respondents due to social desirability bias (Tourangeau
8: Yan, 2007). Many indirect questioning techniques exist, but the list
experiment—also known as the item- or unmatched-count techni-
que—is among the most frequently used (lmai, Park, 8: Greene, 2015).
Compared to the list experiment, other indirect questioning techniques
(e.g., randomized response technique) tend to result in higher item
nonresponse because they are more confusing and burdensome for re-
spondents, and often raise suspicions (Coutts S: Jann, 2011; Droitcour
et al., 1991; Holbrook Sc Krosnick, 2010a).

The list experiment involves randomly assigning respondents to
anmer different versions of a numerical count question, in which they
are asked to indicate how many items in a list are applicable to them,
but not to indicate which items speciﬁcally are applicable (Droitcour
et al., 1991). In this way, respondents are granted privacy through
aggregation—“as long as the entire list does not apply, the respondent
can be assured that the researcher does not know their answer to the
sensitive question" (Glynn, 2013, p. 160). The different versions of the
count question used in a list experiment must be identical with the
exception of the key (sensitive) item—that is, one version includa the
key item (sensitive behavior) along with several additional items (full
list, treatment group), while the other version excludes the key item but
contains the rest of the items (baseline list, control group). In turn,
because of random assignment, the prevalence of the sensitive behavior
can be estimated as the difference between the treatment and control
groups' average responses to the count question.

There is a growing body of evidence supporting the advantages of
the list experiment over direct questioning for asking about sensitive
behaviors (Holbrook 8r Krosnick, 2010b; Rosenfeld, lmai, 81 Shapiro,
2015; Tsuchiya, Hirai, 8: Ono, 2007). The main limitation of the list
experiment is that while it reduces social desirability bias, it yields
estimates with much higher variance (wider conﬁdence intervals) than
direct questioning (Rosenfeld et al., 2015). To increase the efﬁciency

Notes: Within each list, the ordering of the items was randomized for end]
respondent. As intended, there was a positive correlation between responses to
the two lists (r = 0.287).

(or precision) of the estimator, Droitcour et al. (1991) suggest using two
different baseline lists for all respondents, but randomly assigning them
to receive the key item appended to only one of the groups. This
“double list experiment” reduces sampling variability because all re-
spondents serve double duty, simultaneously functioning as both
treatments and controls. To further reduce variance, Glynn (2013) re-
commended using the double list experiment and designing the two
baseline lists so that there are negative within-list correlations between
the items, but a positive between-list correlation. Glynn's (2013) tech-
nique has the additional advantage of reducing the risk of ceiling ef-
fects, which occur when respondents anmer afﬁrmatively to all the
baseline items, thereby forfeiting any privacy on the key (sensitive)
item.

Consistent with these current best practices, the experiment was
conducted and followed Glynn's (2013) recommendations for designing
the baseline lists. Additionally, given evidence that respondents prefer
longer lists, the baseline lists with four items were used (Droitcour
er. al., 1991). The list experiment was the ﬁrst question in the survey.
Both baseline lists and the key item are shown in Table 2.

Several assumptions underlie the list experiment, which when met
strengthen conﬁdence in resultant prevalence estimates (Aronow,
Coppock, Crawford, 8: Green, 2015; lmai, 2011). The ﬁrst is the “1g-
norable Treatment Assignment” assumption, which necessitates that
amignment to the treatment and baseline lists is independent of actual
behavior and survey responses. The second is the “No Liars" assump-
tion, which holds that respondents who have done the sensitive beha-
vior disclose it in the list experiment. Finally, the “No Design Effects”
assumption requires that the inclusion of the key item does not change
respondenm' answers to the other baseline items. Aronow et al. (2015)
developed two placebo tests for assessing the validity of the above as-
sumptions. These tests require that a direct question about the sensitive
behavior is included in the questionnaire for all respondents and as-
sume monotonicity (no false corJessiorrs to direct questions). Typically,
researchers include the direct question only for respondents in the
control group (receiving the baseline list), or for a separate randomly
selected group of respondents who receives only the direct question
(and not the list experiment). In order to conduct the placebo tests,
however, we followed Aronow et al.'s (2015) recommendation to in-
clude a direct question for all respondents (see below).

3.2.2. Direct questions
later in the questionnaire, several questions after the list
D. Roessepowits, er al.

experiment, a direct question about purchasing sex from a prostitute
was included, along with several follow-up contingency questions on
respondents' most recent experience purchasing sex. Although the
questionnaire also included the indirect questioning technique de-
scribed above to measure sex purchasing, several steps were taken to
minimize social desirability bias in responses to the direct questions.
Research shows that self-administration is the most important metho-
dology for ensuring accurate responses to sensitive questions
('l'ourangcau 81 Yan, 2007). Some evidence suggests that the combina-
tion of self— and online-administration may further reduce socially de-
sirable responding in comparison to self-administration with paper
questionnaires ('l‘ourangcau ct al., 2013). For these reasons, our survey
was both self-administered and completed online.

Another strategy for increasing the accuracy of responses to direct
questions about sensitive behaviors is to “warm up" respondents by
gradually and progressively introducing them to other sensitive ques-
tions prior to the key sensitive question (Bradburn, Sudman, 8:
Wansink, 2004; Warwick 8: Linger, 1975). Accordingly, in this survey,
leading up to the direct question about sex purchasing, we included
questions about prior vicarious (family and friends) and personal arrest
experiences (for any offense), and a question asking about drinking and
driving. We assumed these behaviors would be relatively common and
thus less threatening for respondents, compared to sex purchasing.
Consistent with this assumption, 43% of respondents reported having a
family member or friend who had been arrested, 27% reported having
been arrested themselves, and 57% reported driving after drinking
enough alcohol to feel drunk.

Some researchers also suggest using afﬁrmative wording to load
sensitive questions (e.g., presupposing respondents have committed the
behavior, and just asking them about the frequency (Bradburn ct al.,
2004). Consistent with this recommendation, we worded the direct
question as follows: “In the past 3 years, how many different times have
you PAID for sex from a prostitute?” The response options were: None,
Once, 2—3 times, 4—5 times, and 6 or more times. In the analysis, be-
cause of low frequencies, we combine the last two response options.
Following this question, we included several contingency questions
asking about the price of their last encounter in dollars (“Please think
about the last time you paid for sex from a prostitute. How much did
you pay for the sex act?”), the location of the solicitation (“Where did
you ﬁnd the prostitute? On the street, online, or through some other
way?”), and the gender of the prostitute (“Was the prostitute male,
female, or transgender?”).

4. Results

First the ﬁndings from the double list experiment were examined,
which are presented in Table 3. The top panel in Table 3 presents the
unweighted ﬁndings, and the bottom panel presents the weighted
ﬁndings. For List 111, the difference in means between the groups re-
ceiving the full and baseline lists is negative (unweighted = 70.028,
weighted : 70.020). This can happen in list experiments when the

sensitive behavior has a very low prevalence that is outweighed by
sampling variability (chance differences between treatment and control
groups) (Droitcour ct al., 1991, p. 206). For List Y, the difference in
means between the groups receiving the full and baseline lists is posi-
tive, but small (unweighted : 0.076, weighted : 0.059). To combine
the ﬁndings from List X and list Y, we use the equations provided by
Droticour et al. (Droitcour ct al., 1991, p. 189) for calculating the
average estimate and variance. We obtain a combined prevalence es-
timate of approximately 2% (unweighted : 0.024, weighted : 0.020),
and a 95% conﬁdence interval with an upper bound around 6% (un-
weighted = 0.057, weighted = 0.058). Therefore, the overall estimate
of the prevalence of sex purchasing derived from the double list ex-
periment is that roughly 1 in every 50 adult American men (or 2%) has
paid for sex from a prostitute in the last 3 years.

Next, using responses to the direct question on sex purchasing, the
two placebo tests outlined by Aronow ct al. (2015) were conducted to
355855 the assumptions underlying the list experiment. The results are
presented in Tables 4 (bottom panel) and 5. The ﬁrst placebo test jointly
tests the monotonicity, no liars and no design effects assumptions. If
these assumptions hold, then the conﬁdence interval around the esti-
mate from the double list experiment should include 1 for respondents
who admit to purchasing sex in the direct question. The results in the
bottom panel of Table 4 show that this is not the case in our survey
(mean difference = 0.655, 95% C1 = 0420-0390), indicating that at
least one of these assumptions is violated. The second placebo test as-
585595 the ignorable treatment assignment assumption. If this assump-
tion holds, then answers to the direct question should be statistically
independent of treatment assignment (randomization to receive Lists
X5 and Y4, versus Lists X4 and Y5). The results in Table 5 suggest that
this assumption holds in our study—there is not a statistically sig-
niﬁcant difference in responses to the direct question across experi-
mental groups.

Given this evidence of truthful responding, we now trim to the
ﬁndings from the full sample for the direct question. These are pre-
sented in Table 6. The top panel in Table 6 presents the unweighted
ﬁndings, and the bottom panel presents the weighted ﬁndings. First, a
slightly smaller number of respondents answered the direct question
(N = 2484) than responded to the double list experiment (N = 2498).
Second, similar to the results from the double list experiment, responses
to the direct question indicate that sex purchasing is a low prevalence
activity among American men. Speciﬁcally, the weighted ﬁndings in-
dicate that almost 4% of American men (or 1 in 25) have purchased sex
from a prostitute within the past 3years, with a 95% conﬁdence in-
terval ranging from a low of roughly 3% to a high of about 5%. Ac-
cording to the most recent 0.5. Census estimates, there are approxi-
mately 118 million adult men in the U.S. Our ﬁndings from the direct
question would thus suggest that well over 4 million American men
have paid for sex from a prostitute in the past 3years. Third, the evi-
dence indicates that among those men who admit to paying for sex from
a prostitute in the past 3 years, most (roughly 57%) say they have done
so multiple times.

Notes; Table shows estimates from double list experiment disaggregated by respondents' answers to the direct question. Numbers were rounded after calculations

were made. For this analysis, the data are not weighted.

Interestingly, the prevalence estimate obtained from the direct
question (4%, Table 6) is higher than that from the list experiment (2%,
Table 3), although the conﬁdence intervals overlap considerably. Sev-
eral prior studies have also obtained higher prevalence estimates from
direct questions than from list experiments {Biemer 8: Wright, 2005;
Droitcour et al., 1991]. Holbrook and Krosnick (2010b) found that the
list experiment yielded higher prevalence estimates than direct ques-
tions in telephone surveys, but not in eight online self-administered
surveys. Their ﬁndings suggested that “social desirability response bias
did not inﬂate direct self— reports in surveys conducted via the Internet”
(p. 56]. Recall, our study also involved an online self-administered
questionnaire. In our study, there also appears to be little social desir-
ability bias in direct self-reports (top panel, Table 4). Therefore, we
believe the lower prevalence estimate obtained from the double list
experiment, relative to the direct question, most likely reﬂects greater
measurement error in the former, resulting from the higher cognitive
burden imposed on respondents in count questions (see Tsuchiya et al.,
2007). For this reason, we have greater conﬁdence in the direct self-
reported prevalence estimate.

Finally, we examine responses to the contingency questions asked to
respondents who reported purchasing sex in the past 3years. The re-
sults are presented in Table 7. Readers should exercise caution when
interpreting these estimates because the sample size is very limited.
Only 80 respondents reported paying for sex in the past year, and
several of these respondents declined to answer the follow-up ques-
tions.

The ﬁndings from this sample indicate that the average amount paid
for sex in the most recent encounter was approximately $120. Most
(66%) men located the prostitute offline (e.g., on the street, at a bar, or
in a massage parlor), while roughly 34% found the prostitute online
(e.g., through online ads, an escort advertising site, or social media).
The vast majority of men (81%] paid for sex from a female prostitute.

prevalence. Using a nationally representative sample of adult American
males, the current study examines the prevalence of buying sex in the
United States. Speciﬁcally, the evaluation addressed two unique ques-
tions related to sex buying: what proportion of adult men purchased sex
in the past 3 years and what were the circumstances of the transactions.
The ﬁndings from both the double list experiment and the direct ask
question indicate that buying sex is a relatively Iare phenomenon
among adult males, with a range of 24% depending on how the
question was asked.

According to the double list experiment, roughly 2% of adult males
paid for sex in the past 3 years. This ﬁnding should be interpreted with
caution due to sample size, measurement error and violaan of a key
assumption. Asking panicipants directly about buying sex produced a
much higher number of males who had bought sex in the last 3 years
(4%). Based on validity testing, the second estimate of purchasing be-
haviors is the more valid of the two measures. Extrapolated to the entire
adult male population within the United States, this equates to ap-
proximately 4 million men who have bought sex in the past 3years.
These prevalence estimates are considerably lower than most survey
studies (Monte 8r Milrod, 2014] but closer to the capture-recapture
approach (Brewer et al., 2008}. One reason for this may be that prior
research varies in the time period included for estimating.

The current study places more emphasis on recent behavior as op-
posed to long-term buying in an effort to improve our understanding of
contemporary sex buying habits. Additionally, while the estimates are
lower, when extrapolated to the general adult male population, the
scope of the issue — 4 million buyers in the last 3years — is clearly
substantive. When combined with the ﬁnding that over half of the ad-
mitted buyers purchased more than once within the recent past, the
number of total sex buying could easily reach 10 million transactions
(though our limited sample does not allow for an exact computation).

Following the direct ask question, respondents indicated that they
had purchased sex multiple times in the past 3 years (57%). Most stated
that they purchased sex through ofﬂine venues and sought sex from a
female. As to price, the average amount paid for sex, as indicated by
respondents, was $120.00 per encounter. That two thirds of the re-
spondents reported buying sex through offline venues suggestions that
even in a digital age, more traditional modes of purchasing still dom-
inate the market and the focus on community interventions. This de-
viates fmm current research which tends to ﬁnd more sex buyers are
using indoor methods to purchase, especially the 1ntemet {Finn &
Stalans, 2016; Holt Br Blevins, 2007; Milrod 8: Monte, 2012}.

6. Conclusion

While limited, the body of research concerning sex trafﬁcking, sex
work and prostitution is growing and providing new insights into
commercialized sex. Amid increasing national and international de-
bates concerning legalization and decriminalization, the ﬁndings of this
study are especially relevant. This study demonstrates that respondenu
were honest about their behavior, and under anonymous research
conditions will be truthful about sex buying behavior.

Future research should examine attitudes of both buyers and non-
buyers to fully understand their views on paying for sex. Moving be-
yond prevalence estimates, it is critically important that research turn
towards accurate transaction and ﬁnancial ﬁgures. Sample size re-
strictions limit this study to a simple calculation of 4million transac-
tions by the average rate ($120) totaling $430,000,000 during the past
3years. When considering the number of repeat buyers [57% of soli-
citors] and extrapolating the scope of the market, the sex industry could
feasibly produce 10 million transactions and yield a billion dollars in
3 years. Future work exploring ﬂuctuating rates along with transaction
information will produce empirical estimates of the true ﬁnancial value
of the sex work industry. Finally, expanding upon this study, re-
searchers should examine the gender preferences of sex purchasers. Our
ﬁndings show that almost 20% of buyers are interested in same sex

encounters. Sarne sex transactions have yet to gain traction within sex
work research even though our ﬁndings clearly demonstrate that such a
demand exists.

Estimates of the demand for commercial sex are deceptively low in
all studies. However, using a nationally representative sample allows
for a valid and reliable statistic that can be extrapolated to the entire
population. Under this lens, roughly 1 out of every 25 adult males has
bought sex in the past 3 years. Fifty-seven percent of buyers admitted to
purchasing sex more than once during this timefrarne, making this a
conservative estimate of sex buying among adult males. While not the
focus of the current study, the scope of the industry and the number of
men who engage prostitutes for sex demonstrated by this research
certainly exceeds the criminal justice, public health, and human service
sectors‘ ability to address the issue in the United States.
